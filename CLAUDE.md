# NorskCoach — Project Context for Claude Code

## What This Is

An adaptive Norwegian language learning web app. Not a course — a coach. It builds a per-user mistake fingerprint, generates a personalized session every time, and runs every wrong answer through a repair loop with spaced-repetition follow-up.

**One-line positioning:** A personal Norwegian tutor that finds your weak spots, explains why they happen, and fixes them with targeted practice — and pushes you to actually speak.

This file is the single source of truth for how to work on this project. If anything you believe about the project conflicts with this file, this file wins. If this file conflicts with observed code, stop and flag it — do not silently work around it.

## The Moat

Three things working together. Everything serves these:

1. **Diagnosis** — knowing precisely what the learner is failing at, including root causes under surface mistakes.
2. **Scheduling** — generating a personalized session that mixes remediation, review, new material, and interleaving.
3. **Remediation** — every wrong answer triggers explain → micro-drill → retry → schedule for spaced review.

External research (see `docs/validation-and-research.md`) confirmed this combination is genuinely differentiated against Lingu, Babbel, Busuu, and the Norskprøven prep ecosystem. No competitor does root-cause diagnosis. The moat is the diagnostic coaching intelligence — not the SRS, not the exercise types, not the model.

AI is a power tool that supports the coaching. AI is never the headline. Every AI path has a non-AI fallback.

## The North Star (Results Principle)

The app exists to make the user speak more Norwegian and build sentences confidently. Two layered outcomes: production fluency (can construct sentences) and speaking confidence (actually does, in low-stakes varied contexts). Every feature must push toward production. A pure-recognition feature fails this test unless wrapped with an output requirement.

The "Norwegian dominates the screen" principle applies to learning surfaces (session loop, translation, fill-in-blank, word-order, journal, muntlig). It does not apply to assessment surfaces (diagnostic, recalibration) where English instructions with Norwegian options are correct by design — instruction clarity matters more than immersion when measuring placement.

## Tech Stack (ACTUAL — not aspirational)

- **Platform:** Web. Next.js (App Router), TypeScript strict, Tailwind.
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS).
- **State:** Zustand stores; fingerprint persists to IndexedDB, syncs to Supabase fire-and-forget for auth users.
- **AI (hybrid):** Desktop: WebLLM in a Web Worker via WebGPU (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, ~400MB, client-side). Mobile: Groq API via `/api/ai` server route (Llama 3.1 8B, server-side, requires `GROQ_API_KEY`). Fallback: template/rule responses when neither path is available. Profile page shows current AI mode (Lokal/Sky/Maler). Core engine does NOT depend on AI — every AI path has a non-AI fallback. Future upgrade: NB-Llama (Norwegian-fine-tuned) for both paths.
- **Typography:** Schibsted Grotesk (single family, display 700 / body 400). Designed by Schibsted (Norwegian media) for Scandinavian digital reading; æ/ø/å are primary design requirements.
- **Hosting target:** small EU VPS + Supabase EU region. Free per user is a hard constraint.

There is no iOS app, no Swift, no MLX, no SwiftUI. Earlier design docs describing those are historical artifacts from a deferred native plan. Do not act on them.

## Current State (VERIFIED — the engine is complete)

The adaptive engine is built, traced, and verified correct:

- **Diagnostic placement** — IRT-style adaptive quiz, seeds the fingerprint (rawScore is pure accuracy: correctCount/attemptCount × 100, confidence 0.4). Cold-start traced and confirmed: new users get real adaptation from session one. Note: DiagnosticResult.rawScore is 0-1 IRT scale, distinct from ConceptMastery.rawScore which is 0-100 EMA scale.
- **Mistake fingerprint** — JSON blob in IndexedDB + Supabase. Per-concept: rawScore, confidenceScore, decayedScore, attempts, uniqueDaysActive, streak, recentOutcomes, SRS state (nextReviewAt, srsLevel). Plus error log (200 cap), error patterns, production gap, speaking minutes, input/production preference.
- **Mastery scoring** — phase-adaptive EMA (α: intro 0.40 → practice 0.25 → consolidation 0.15 → maintenance 0.08), slip detection (a wrong answer after 4/5 recent correct counts at 30% weight), geometric-mean confidence.
- **Decay** — exponential half-life, decays toward floor of 35 (not zero). Half-life is **25 days** (Stream 1.2 shipped); see `src/engine/fingerprint.ts:12`.
- **Calibration window** — first 5 sessions use a 30/30/30/10 recipe variant (Stream 1.3 shipped); see `src/hooks/useSession.ts:188`.
- **Phase model** — locked → intro → practice → consolidation → maintenance, computed live.
- **Scheduler** — recipe 40/30/20/10 (remediation/review/new/interleaving), pulls up to 5 focus concepts (3 weakest by decayedScore + up to 2 SRS-due), SRS-driven review pool, repeat cap (interleaving pool bypasses the repeat cap via `addItem` not `addItemCapped`), production guarantee, Fisher-Yates shuffle. **Weekly Sprint bias (Stream 5):** the 40% remediation pool biases toward `weeklyFocus` via priority ordering (focus concepts first, then weak, then unlocked). **Passed-sentence filtering:** the scheduler consults `passedSentenceIds` and excludes passed sentences from remediation, new-material, and interleaving pools. Review items explicitly allow passed sentences (`excludePassed: false`) for intentional spaced repetition. When all sentences for a concept are passed, the concept is skipped for non-review purposes; AI top-up generates fresh content. Every `SessionItem` carries a required `selectionReason` (`weak_concept` | `review_due` | `decaying` | `new_material` | `interleaving` | `weekly_focus` | `repair_target` | `cold_start`) justifying its inclusion. **CEFR-level sentence filter:** `filterSentencesByLevel` in scheduler.ts ensures sentences are filtered to the learner's current level or below — an A1 learner never sees B1+ sentences even for shared concepts.
- **Weekly Sprint engine (Stream 5)** — `selectWeeklyFocus`, `shouldResetWeek`, `closeWeek`, `openWeek`, `ensureWeekOpen` in `src/engine/weekly-sprint.ts`. Graduation rule promotes/demotes on close.
- **Diagnosis engine** — 4 root-cause rules on real error data. Output surfaced on dashboard session card.
- **Repair loop** — template explanation + 2 micro-drills + retry + SRS scheduling on the ladder 1→3→7→14→30 days. Wrong answers reset SRS level to 0 (full restart of the ladder).
- **AI validity gate** — all AI surfaces flow through `validateNorwegianOutput` in `src/ai/validate.ts`. Failed validation → per-surface template fallback.
- **Prompt hardening (Stream 1.1 Step 1)** — all 5 prompt builders in `src/ai/prompts.ts` carry Norwegian-enforcement system rules.
- **Event logging (Stream 1.4 writes)** — `src/lib/logEvents.ts` writes anonymized per-exercise and per-weekly-check rows to `learning_events_log` for auth users; guests excluded.
- **Error tagging** — uses sentence's real `error_tags_detectable`, not guessed from exercise type.
- **Content dedup** — no repeated sentence within a session. Cross-session: `passedSentenceIds` prevents passed sentences from reappearing in normal progression; defense-in-depth in `useSession.ts` triggers AI content generation when seed pool is exhausted.
- **Full pipeline parity** — session, conversation, journal, AND weekly check all feed the identical mastery + SRS pipeline.

Built features: diagnostic, dashboard (with WeekStrip + mid-week reveal + lane strip), session loop, repair loop, conversation mode (AI tutor + constraints + focus bias), journal (focus-biased prompts), reading (concept-tagged texts with exposure logging), progress, profile (with level display + preference toggle), weekly retrieval check at `/uke`, scripted roleplay at `/roleplay` (focus-aware scenarios), shared repair module (`repairFromSurface`), AudioPlayer component (browser TTS fallback), analytics surface (`/analytics`), AlertDialog primitive.

Retired surfaces: `/vocab` → honest "Kommer i versjon 2" banner. `/recalibrate` → redirects to `/uke`.

Live muntlig modes: `/shadow` (shadowing — listen + repeat + word matching), `/drills` (pronunciation drills — 4 sound groups + heuristic feedback), `/listen` (listen-and-respond — 8 questions with focus-biased ordering). All three feed the fingerprint and lane completion system. Dashboard "Muntlig" section links to all three.

Stubs / not built: vocab SRS, reading comprehension scoring.

## Current Phase

**SHIP-READY 2026-05-27.** All 12 ship-ready criteria met. Four-dimensional market-readiness audit passed. See `docs/vision-and-plan.md` for the full execution plan.

**What's shipped:**
- Stream 5.5 Phases 3-8 (all surfaces laned, repair externalized, stubs retired, recalibration retired)
- Wave 0: CLAUDE.md sync, `/listen`+`/drills` muted, F027 repair-loop cap
- Wave 1: Audio pipeline — 1,117+ MP3 files generated via edge-tts (nb-NO-PernilleNeural), AudioPlayer wired to real paths with browser TTS fallback. All 4 CEFR levels have audio coverage.
- Wave 2: Analytics surface v1 + moat metric defined + history cap confirmed
- Wave 3: Dashboard composition, progress trajectory, 27 dead CSS classes removed, BottomNav Norwegian
- Wave 4: B1 concept graph (12 concepts), B1 corpus (360 sentences, 30/concept), all 16 files migrated to `getGraphForLevel`, B1 level selectable
- Wave 4.5: B2 concept graph (12 concepts), B2 corpus (360 sentences, 30/concept), B2 audio (360 MP3s)
- Norwegian-dominates pass across ALL learning surfaces (~99% Norwegian)
- Auth redirect confirmed working
- Market-readiness audit: security headers, error boundaries (Norwegian), loading skeletons, CEFR sentence filter, API rate limiter (30 req/min), `.env.local.example` credentials cleaned

**Next (operational, not code):** Rotate Supabase keys (old keys in git history), deploy to pandoai.no, auth completion (magic-link end-to-end test). V2 engine (Wave 5) blocked on real users.

## Operating Rules (HARD RAILS — these caused real problems when absent)

1. **Depth, not breadth.** Do not add feature surface. Finish and harden the current phase before proposing anything new. Adding features while foundations are open is the documented failure mode of this project.

2. **Analysis-first on decisions; direct on mechanics.** If a task involves a reversible architectural or design choice, produce an analysis with 2–3 options and tradeoffs and STOP for approval. If a task is mechanical and well-understood, do it directly and show the diff. Do not run analysis loops on one-line fixes; do not build architectural changes without analysis.

3. **Verify, don't assume.** Before declaring anything done, produce a concrete trace against stated acceptance criteria. "It should work" is not verification. A wrong audit was caught this way; conversation parity was confirmed this way. This is mandatory.

4. **One move at a time.** Finish the current move, verify it, summarize what changed, then stop. Do not chain into the next move unprompted.

5. **Surface drift, don't route around it.** If code conflicts with this file or a spec, or if a request seems to contradict the moat or north star, raise it as an explicit question. Do not silently reinterpret the request to make it fit.

6. **No silent substitution.** Never make a feature appear to work when it doesn't (the old B1/B2-runs-A2 pattern). Honest banners over silent fallbacks.

7. **Scope discipline on prompts.** If asked to fix X, fix X. Do not also refactor Y, restyle Z, or build the thing you think should come next. Note adjacent issues; don't act on them without approval.

8. **Pipeline honesty.** If a surface claims to contribute to the fingerprint, mastery, or repair loop, that contribution must be traced end-to-end before the surface ships. A UI that shows a correction card is making a claim about the learning engine, not just about pixels. Five separate surfaces during P0 recovery were found to silently contribute nothing: the AI badge, error tags, session progression, journal correction, and conversation grammar logging. Before any "feeds the engine" feature ships, trace the write: confirm an entry lands in the error log, the mastery score changes, or the SRS state updates — in a real session, not in theory.

## The Architect Subagent

This project has an architect subagent at `.claude/agents/architect.md`. Its job is direction, sequencing, and pushback — NOT writing code. Consult it before starting any phase, when a request might be breadth-not-depth, when scope is unclear, or when a decision has architectural weight. The architect proposes and challenges; the main session executes after approval. Treat its scope/direction flags as blocking until resolved with the user.

## Documents That Outrank This File On Their Specific Domains

- `docs/vision-and-plan.md` — the unified vision, ship-ready definition, dependency map, and wave-ordered execution plan. The forward-looking source of truth for what to build next.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — the historical build record with per-phase closure notes, research citations, and procedural locks.
- `docs/muntlig/architecture.md` — the full muntlig module architecture (audio, pronunciation, content, branching, timing). When muntlig is built, this is the spec.
- `docs/validation-and-research.md` — the research findings on model quality, SRS, decay, mastery, cold-start, competitive position. The reasoning behind the engine corrections lives here. Read this if you wonder why a decision was made.
- `docs/ui-1/` — aesthetic direction, token contract, typeface analysis, shadcn audit, type scale. The UI phase's source of truth.

If those docs conflict with each other or with this file, surface the conflict — don't pick.

## When in Doubt

Re-read the moat and the north star above. Every decision should trace to one of them. If it doesn't, it's probably out of scope — raise it, don't build it.

## How to Start a Session

1. Read this file fully.
2. Read `docs/roadmap.md` for the current sequence.
3. State the current phase and what's in scope.
4. For anything non-trivial, propose a plan and stop for approval (Operating Rule 2).
5. Do not ask the user to re-explain the project. It's all here.
